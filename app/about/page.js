		<p>
			My name is Michal Kotowski. I am an aspiring music producer, graphic
			designer, but most of all - a developer. I love being outdoors, riding my
			bike and expanding my skills in all areas. I&apos;m into minimalism,
			mindfulness and self-development. Based in Warsaw.

			I would like to thank the creators of lofi hip hop, without whom I would
			not be able to concentrate and accomplish all the things I have achieved.
